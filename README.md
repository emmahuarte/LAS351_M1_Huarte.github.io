# LIS351_M1_Huarte.github.io
Fulfilling the requirements of LIS351 Major Project 1

This repository contains a scaffold of a 5-page website for the LIS351 Module 1 assignment.

Pages included:
- `index.html` — Home page (intro)
- `travel.html` — Travel page (unique two-column layout)
- `family.html` — Family page
- `work.html` — Work page
- `friends.html` — Friends page

Assets:
- `css/style.css` — External stylesheet linked from all pages
- `images/photo1.svg`, `images/photo2.svg`, `images/photo3.svg` — SVG placeholders

What you need to do:
- Replace placeholder text and images with your own content.
- Validate pages with WAVE (https://wave.webaim.org/) and fix any alerts as needed. There should be no validation errors.

Preview locally:

If you have Python installed, run a simple HTTP server from the repository root and open http://localhost:8000 in your browser:

```bash
# macOS / zsh
cd /Users/emmahuarte/Documents/LIS351/LIS351_M1_Huarte.github.io
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open the pages and check navigation and styles.

Notes:
- The travel page (`travel.html`) uses a grid layout to satisfy the "unique layout" requirement.
- Headings, lists, description lists, images with alt text, nav on each page, and an external link are included as placeholders.

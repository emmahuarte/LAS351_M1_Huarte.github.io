      <p>I studied abroad last semester in Barcelona, and travelled every weekend. It was one of the most amazing experiences and I am so grateful I was able to take advantage of the opportunity.</p>

          <p class="dest-desc">Paris was one of the most beautiful places I have ever been to. I was with two of my best friends and we ate our way through the city. We wore berets, got crossaints at every corner, and were tourists at the Palace of Versailles. I would love to go back someday!</p>
